### Hi, I'm Kevin

I'm a hobbyist programmer who enjoys working in the domain of real-time applications and machine learning. I'm currently a PhD student at USC in EE studying signal processing. I've also graduated with a Masters from UCSD (where I also did my undergraduate degree) in Computer Science with an emphasis on Artificial Intelligence. I am passionate about computer audition (espetially deep learning techniques on analyzing/generating audio), but I also like studying interractive computer graphics and animation on the side.
