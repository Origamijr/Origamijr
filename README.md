### Hi, I'm Kevin

I'm a hobbyist programmer who enjoys working in the domain of real-time applications and machine learning. I am passionate about interpretable methods in computer audio processing (for both speech and music), but I also like studying interractive computer graphics and animation on the side. Currently a PhD student at University of Southern California studying speech production.
