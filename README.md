### Hi, I'm Kevin

I'm a hobbyist programmer who enjoys working in the domain of real-time applications and machine learning. I am passionate about computer audition (espetially deep learning techniques on analyzing/generating audio), but I also like studying interractive computer graphics and animation on the side.
